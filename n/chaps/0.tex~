\newsection{Correctness}

It is \emph{\textbf{impossible}} to design an algorithm to analyze if general algorithms are going to halt or not, emphasis on \textit{general}.
\subtext{\underline{Halting Problem}}


With specific algorithms or base-cases in such algorithms it is possible to know when and how it will halt.

\textbf{Induction}
Accepted axioms:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Well-Ordering Principle (WOP):
  \[ if X \subseteq \mathbb{N} = {0, 1, \dots}\] is nonempty, then X has a least element $\exists m \in X$ s.t. $m \leq x$,  $\forall x \in X$ \sidenote{``LEAST'' IN THIS CASE \textbf{ DOES NOT} mean it is WITHIN THE BOUNDS. It means there is an element that is \textit{SMALLER} THAN THE SMALLEST ELEMENT IN X \EMPHASIZE{!!!}}
